## What is Bootstrap Kit?

Bootstrap Kit is a Web Framework for developing full-stack web applications using.. you guessed it. Bootstrap Components! This sort of framework is similar to something like [SvelteKit](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/introduction), where you utlize [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) to build the user interface, while SvelteKit does all the heavy lifting.

Bootstrap Kit is pretty similar to this, where you utilize our Bootstrap Components to build the user interface, then use the Kit to handle things such as routing, dynamic content, scripts, and the like.

### Key Features

Bootstrap Kit is packaged with a bunch of features that will definately help with your development.

## What is Bootsrap?

In short, [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) is a HTML, CSS, and JavaScript library filled with pre-made components -- like a navbar, buttons, or dropdowns -- You use these pre-made components to make a user interface. You can also choose to use a bunch of helpers with Bootstrap, such as Sass, 

You don't necessarily need to know Bootstrap to use Bootstrap Kit, but it is recommended, and will definately help. For more information, check out the <i class="bi bi-book-half"></i> [Bootstrap Documentation](https://getbootstrap.com).

## Bootstrap VS Bootstrap Kit

Bootstrap is a collection of pre-made, ready to use components. You can compose these components and render an entire page with the HTML, but you need more than just HTML and components to write an entire app.

That's where Bootstrap Kit comes in. Bootstrap Kit helps you build web applications with all the best practices, complete with a ton of [features](#key-features). The main thing is that Bootstrap Kit does all the heavy lifting, you just need to learn about how it works. if you're coming from a framework such as [NextJS](https://nextjs.org), or [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com), some of our concept may be already familiar to you.
