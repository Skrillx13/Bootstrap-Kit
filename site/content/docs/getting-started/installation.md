## Before You Begin

<i class="bi bi-lightbulb-fill"></i> It's important to note that Bootstrap Kit only provides support for Node JS and Deno. Any other Package Manager such as Homebrew, Scoop, and Choco are not officially supported, meaning there is no gurantee you will receive help when you encounter an issue. 

It is also important to note that community packages (Bootstrap Kit extensions, Bootstrap Kit forked versions) may be unstable or have malware in them, as such download these packages at your own risk. Now with that saying, let's get started.
